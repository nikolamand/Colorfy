Aside from the way to use the extension that is explained in the YouTube video, there is an advanced mode when you click on the cog icon in the bottom right corner that shows all the elements saved on for that URL.
This mode can be used to delete any existing elements. You can also add new ones based on element class or id by adding elements class name and the color you wish to use (for the background you can use anything you want: image, gradient color, combination of colors and images...). You can also change existing elements by changing the object in a way you wish to do so and then going outside that object and pressing the enter key the object will be edited.
There is a priority for the changes of the elements, the element that was changed last has the highest priority.

# Colorfy Multi-Style Feature

## Overview

The Colorfy extension now supports multiple color styles per website, allowing users to create, manage, and switch between different color schemes for the same web page.

## Key Features

### 1. **Multiple Styles per Website**
- Up to 5 different color styles per website
- Each style maintains its own set of color changes
- Styles are saved independently and can be switched instantly

### 2. **Style Management Interface**
- **Style Selector Dropdown**: Located at the top of the color picker, shows all available styles
- **Edit Button**: Opens the style management modal for advanced operations
- **Original Style**: Always available, shows the webpage in its original state

### 3. **Style Management Modal**
- **Add New Style**: Create new color schemes (up to 5 total)
- **Rename Styles**: Click on style names to edit them inline
- **Delete Styles**: Remove unwanted styles with confirmation
- **Style Overview**: See how many color changes each style contains

## User Experience

### For New Users
- When first using Colorfy on a website, two styles are automatically created:
  - **"Original"**: The unchanged webpage (read-only)
  - **"Style 1"**: Pre-selected for making color changes
- This ensures a seamless experience without requiring setup

### For Existing Users
- Existing color changes are automatically migrated to "Style 1"
- The "Original" style is added for easy comparison
- All previous functionality remains intact

## Technical Implementation

### New Modules
1. **`styleManager.js`**: Core functionality for managing multiple styles
2. **`styleSelector.js`**: UI components for style selection and editing

### Data Structure
```javascript
// New storage format: Colorfy_Styles
{
  "https://example.com": {
    "styles": [
      {
        "id": "original",
        "name": "Original",
        "elements": [],
        "isOriginal": true
      },
      {
        "id": "style_1",
        "name": "My Dark Theme",
        "elements": [/* color changes */],
        "isOriginal": false
      }
    ],
    "activeStyle": "style_1"
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing data in the old format (`Colorfy`) is automatically migrated
- Legacy storage is preserved until migration is complete
- No data loss during the upgrade process

- `.style_edit_btn__Colorfy`
- `.style_edit_modal__Colorfy`
- `.style_edit_content__Colorfy`

2. **Template Styles**: Pre-made color schemes for common use cases
3. **Style Scheduling**: Automatically switch styles based on time of day
